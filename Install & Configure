How do I tell if Squid is running?
You can use the squidclient program:

% squidclient http://www.netscape.com/ > test
There are other command-line HTTP client programs available as well. Two that you may find useful are wget and echoping.

Another way is to use Squid itself to see if it can signal a running Squid process:

% squid -k check
And then check the shell's exit status variable.

Also, check the log files, most importantly the access.log and cache.log files.

squid command line options
These are the command line options for Squid-2:

-a Specify an alternate port number for incoming HTTP requests. Useful for testing a configuration file on a non-standard port.

-d Debugging level for "stderr" messages. If you use this option, then debugging messages up to the specified level will also be written to stderr.

-f Specify an alternate squid.conf file instead of the pathname compiled into the executable.

-h Prints the usage and help message.

-k reconfigure Sends a HUP signal, which causes Squid to re-read its configuration files.

-k rotate Sends an USR1 signal, which causes Squid to rotate its log files. Note, if logfile_rotate is set to zero, Squid still closes and re-opens all log files.

-k shutdown Sends a TERM signal, which causes Squid to wait briefly for current connections to finish and then exit. The amount of time to wait is specified with shutdown_lifetime.

-k interrupt Sends an INT signal, which causes Squid to shutdown immediately, without waiting for current connections.

-k kill Sends a KILL signal, which causes the Squid process to exit immediately, without closing any connections or log files. Use this only as a last resort.

-k debug Sends an USR2 signal, which causes Squid to generate full debugging messages until the next USR2 signal is recieved. Obviously very useful for debugging problems.

-k check Sends a "ZERO" signal to the Squid process. This simply checks whether or not the process is actually running.

-s Send debugging (level 0 only) message to syslog.

-u Specify an alternate port number for ICP messages. Useful for testing a configuration file on a non-standard port.

-v Prints the Squid version.

-z Creates disk swap directories. You must use this option when installing Squid for the first time, or when you add or modify the cache_dir configuration.

-D Do not make initial DNS tests. Normally, Squid looks up some well-known DNS hostnames to ensure that your DNS name resolution service is working properly. (!) obsolete in 3.1 and later.

-F If the swap.state logs are clean, then the cache is rebuilt in the "foreground" before any requests are served. This will decrease the time required to rebuild the cache, but HTTP requests will not be satisfied during this time.

-N Do not automatically become a background daemon process.

-R Do not set the SO_REUSEADDR option on sockets.

-X Enable full debugging while parsing the config file.

-Y Return ICP_OP_MISS_NOFETCH instead of ICP_OP_MISS while the swap.state file is being read. If your cache has mostly child caches which use ICP, this will allow your cache to rebuild faster.
